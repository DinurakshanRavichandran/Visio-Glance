            <h3>What is Visio Glance?</h3>
            <p>Visio Glance is an AI-powered multimodal diagnostic tool that will be specially designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing retinal diseases with higher accuracy and efficiency. The system will integrate fundus imaging, OCT scans, and patient-reported symptoms to identify retinal diseases and provide comprehensive insights into conditions like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and macular degeneration. Through combining multiple data sources, Visio Glance will aim to improve early disease detection and assist in better decision-making to reduce medical errors. This platform will make use of image analysis models to detect both surface-level and structural retinal abnormalities while incorporating symptoms-based diagnosis to tailor to individual patient outcomes</p>

            <h3>Millions Affected by Eye Diseases</h3>
            <p>Globally, over 2.2 billion people suffer from vision impairment or blindness, with at least 1 billion of these cases being preventable or untreated. The leading causes include uncorrected refractive errors, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. Many of these conditions develop gradually and remain undetected until significant damage occurs; however, early detection and timely intervention could prevent or treat up to 80% of these cases, significantly improving quality of life and reducing the overall healthcare burden, though barriers such as limited access to eye care, lack of awareness, and high costs continue to prevent millions from receiving the necessary treatment.</p>
