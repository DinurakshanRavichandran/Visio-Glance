## Overview
Visio Glance is an advanced, AI-driven diagnostic support system designed to aid healthcare professionals in the early detection and accurate identification of eye diseases. By integrating multimodal data sources—fundus images, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, and patient-reported symptoms—Visio Glance offers a unified, explainable, and high-performance diagnostic tool.

## Project Motivation
Early diagnosis of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration is critical for preventing vision loss and optimizing patient outcomes. Traditional methods are often slow, error-prone, and dependent on specialist availability. Visio Glance addresses these challenges by:
- Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for image analysis.
- Incorporating NLP for the assessment of patient symptoms.
- Applying Explainable AI (XAI) methods (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM) to provide transparency in predictions.
- Offering a comprehensive and user-friendly diagnostic platform.

## Features
- **Multimodal Data Integration:** Combines fundus images, OCT scans, and textual symptom data.
- **Advanced Image Analysis:** Leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high-accuracy disease detection.
- **Symptom-Based Prediction:** Employs NLP techniques to extract insights from patient-reported symptoms.
- **Explainable AI:** Uses LIME, SHAP, and Grad-CAM to visually and quantitatively explain model decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive environment for data upload, analysis, and report generation.
- **Robust Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance tests ensure system reliability.

## Architecture & Design
Visio Glance is built with a modular architecture that separates data handling, model processing, and user interaction:
- **Data Ingestion Layer:** Facilitates uploading, validation, and preprocessing of both image and text data.
- **Modeling Layer:** Implements various AI models (e.g., CNNs, Random Forest, XGBoost) for diagnostic predictions.
- **Explainability Module:** Generates visual (heatmaps) and textual explanations to elucidate model decisions.
- **User Interface:** A responsive Streamlit-based front end for seamless user interactions.
- **Backend API:** A Flask-powered REST API to manage communication between modules.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK, spaCy
- **Explainable AI:** LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM
